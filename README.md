# Parking lot for cars and trucks

Parking lot represented by a matrix where a car holds one position and a truck holds two. The vehicles that arrive to the parking lot take a position randomly and keep it a random time and then they leave. When the parking lot is full, the vehicles that arrive have to wait until some space is freed.
